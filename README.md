# ECOM-AI-AGENT-Using-GenAI
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that lets you ask natural-language questions ("What is my total sales?", "Which product had the highest CPC?", etc.) about your e-commerce business. The AI agent converts your question into an SQL query, fetches data from your database, then displays results, SQL logic, and visualizationsâ€”fully interactively.

Features
Ask business questions in plain English

LLM-powered SQL generation: Converts your questions into SQL automatically

Results from your actual database

Transparent: Shows the SQL query used and the AI's raw thinking

Interactive tables and auto-generated visualizations (bar, line, and metric charts)

Typewriter/streaming effect for answers
